### Hello Reader and Welcome! 

Since you have clicked on this blog post, you are probably wondering what Clicks to Code is? 

Clicks to Code is a personal blog website that serves several important roles to its author; the most important of which is being an outlet for the author to discuss and learn about topics related to Salesforce and other web technologies. 

Keep reading to find out more about the author and Clicks to Code! 

### About the Author

Sam, the Author of Clicks to Code, is based out of Phoenix, AZ and lives with his Wife Andrea and dog Emma. He is a Salesforce System Administrator/Developer with 6 years experience with the platform. 

Sam first began working in IT as an *IT Application Support Analyst* with a focus in supporting Salesforce. He quickly learned the role and was promoted up to System Administrator. Part of Sam's responsibilities, as a new Administrator, was to support a 2,000+ user roll out by maintaining the metadata in a Salesforce training sandbox, provisioning feature set licenses to new users, and helping support new Salesforce functionality after every release. After the rollout, Sam's roll transitioned to accepting enhancement requests, requiring configuration changes, to improve the Salesforce environment. This involved meeting with business stakeholders, gathering requirements for no-code configuration changes, and then implementing the changes in a dev environment, where these changes were QA'd and eventually promoted to Production. During this time, Sam learned about versioning control and how to keep his metadata changes from impacting other developers. 

It was at this time that Sam began seeing the kinds of solutions that Developers could bring to the table and it ignited a fire within him to pursue Development as his preferred career choice going forward. 

Sam slowly started taking on more responsibilities from other developers; whether it was changing the color of a table in a Lightning Web Component or adding a null checker to an Apex class, he was hooked. Eventually, Sam's boss noticed that his responsibilities looked similar to that of the other developers on the team and invited him to participate in sprint teams. Since then, Sam has gotten to work on Lightning Web Components, Apex Triggers, Platform Cache, and has had the opportunity to trouble shoot and resolve business critical data sync issues.

While Salesforce plays a major role in Sam's life, he is also interested in web development and is working on his professional website: Clicks to Code. Sam is also a degreed Meteorologist and enjoys chasing tornadoes with his college friends out in the central United States. He also enjoys eating at local restaurants with his wife Andrea, walking his dog Emma in the evenings, playing guitar (John Petrucci is his favorite guitarist), binge watching Netflix shows, and being a book worm.

### Clicks to Code name?

If you view the author's career progression - support, system administrator, and finally developer - you can see that he performed configuration changes in the beginning (clicks) and code changes in the end (code). Together, his experience spans from clicks to code!

### Clicks to Code Objective?
