### About the Author

Sam, the Author of Clicks to Code, is based out of Phoenix, AZ and lives with his Wife Andrea and dog Emma. He is primarily a Salesforce System Administrator/Developer with 6 years experience with the platform. 

Sam first began working in IT as an *IT Application Support Analyst* with a focus in supporting Salesforce. He quickly learned the role and was promoted up to System Administrator. Part of Sam's responsibilities as an Admin was to maintain a Salesforce training sandbox and to support a 2,000+ user roll out into uncharted territory. After 6 months, the roll out tapered off and Sam took on additional responsibilities. He began meeting with key business stakeholders, gathering requirements for non-code configuration changes, and then solutioning and implementing the changes himself. During this time, he learned about versioning control and  was able to commit his changes to a repository so that his metadata changes did not conflict with other developers. 

Working in tandem with and seeing the kinds of solutions that Developers can bring to the table ignited a fire within Sam to pursue Development as his next rung in his career latter. 

Sam slowly started taking on more responsibilities from other developers; whether it was changing the color of a table in a Lightning Web Component or adding a null checker to an Apex class, Sam was hooked. Eventually, Sam's boss noticed that his responsibilities looked similar to that of the other developers on the team and invited him to participate in the sprint teams. Since then, Sam has gotten to work on some tricky Lightning Web Components, Apex Triggers, and has had the opportunity to trouble shoot and resolve some tricky data sync issues.

While Salesforce plays a major role in Sam's life, he is also interested in web technologies and is working on his current website: Clicks to Code. Sam is also a degreed Meteorologist and enjoys chasing tornadoes with his college friends out in the central United States. Sam also enjoys walking his dog Emma in the evenings, playing guitar (John Petrucci is his favorite guitarist), binging Netflix shows, and being the occassional book worm.
