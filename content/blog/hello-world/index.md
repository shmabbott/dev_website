### Welcome Reader

If you are familiar with Sales or CRM, you have probably heard of the company *Salesforce.* Salesforce is the dominate technology in the CRM space and it features many tools that allow its administrators and developers to scale up and deliver high class functionality to a wide variety of users at a fraction of the time compared to its competitors.

Being a professional in this space requires a commitment to learning the Salesforce platform, keeping up with new releases, and learning technologies that are related to the paltform, which can be overwhelming. Clicks to Code was created to help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed and to reinforce these concepts. 

Clicks to Code is a custom blog website that is built on Gatsby JS. The idea is to write about topics ranging from Salesforce to Web Development; which, overtime, will result in a repository of articles. These articles can be used by the author to relearn concepts in the future and for peers to learn new concepts.
